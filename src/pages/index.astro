        I grew up in a technology-filled environment and started exploring the
        engineering and development area since I was 11 years old.

        <br />

        <p>
          Since I've been a tech and games enthusiast, I started watching guides
          on programming and game making.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I began my journey developing my own game server of an MMORPG game
          (Metin2) in 2010 which included working with PHP, HTML, Lua and more.
          I built a website, registration form connected to a database,
          configured a game client and basically worked clientside and
          serverside.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As a youngster I participated in a lot of activities as so playing
          violin, joining the singing chorus, music classes, English institute
          and the most self-developing, swimming competitively.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          These activities helped a lot in my character and personality
          development and I'm glad I learned a lot with every single one of
          them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The most relevant "hobby" was the competitive swimming because I had
          to be really rigorous, self-disciplined, motivated in order to do well
          in practices to prepare properly for the competitions. In my club I
          felt like a leader because I was the person that kept looking for
          others and helped the team stay motivated, and that taught me a lot in
          terms of team management and leadership.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To sum up, I consider myself a very organized, hardworking and
          flexible person that can learn about all kinds of subject (IT related)
          with ease.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am always seeking to assist others and I have a great spirit of
          leadership.
        </p>
